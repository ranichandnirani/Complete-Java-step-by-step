Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values.

Types of Operators:
1. Arithmetic Operators:
                        Used for mathematical calculations.
                        + - * / %

2. Relational Operators:
                        Used to compare two values.
                        == != > < >= <=

3. Logical Operators:
                    Used to combine conditions.
                    && || !

4. Assignment Operators:
                        Used to assign values.
                        = += -= *= /=

5. Unary Operators:
                Operate on a single operand.
                ++ -- + - !

6. Bitwise Operators:
                Operate on binary values.
                & | ^ ~ << >>

Operator Precedence:
                Determines the order of execution of operators in an expression.

Binary Numbers:
            Binary numbers are number systems that use only two digits: 0 and 1.
            Computers use binary numbers to store and process data.

Binary to Decimal Conversion:
Example:
        1010₂ = 10₁₀

Decimal to Binary Conversion:
Example:
        10₁₀ = 1010₂

Binary Operators in Java:
                        Bitwise operators work directly on binary data.
Example:
        5 & 3 = 1

Operators perform operations, while binary numbers form the foundation of computer processing.
