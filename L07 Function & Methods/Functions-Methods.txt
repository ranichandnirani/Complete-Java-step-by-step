In Java, a function is called a method.
A method is a block of code that performs a specific task and is executed when called.

Method Definition:
                A method is defined inside a class.
Syntax:
        returnType methodName(parameters) {
            // code
        }

Types of Methods:

1. Predefined Methods:
                    Methods already available in Java libraries.
Example: 
        1. println() 
        2. sqrt()
        3. length()

2. User-Defined Methods:
                        Methods created by the programmer.
Example:
        void display() {
            System.out.println("Hello");
        }

Method Parameters:
                1. Parameters – values passed to a method
                2. Return type – value returned by a method using return

Method Calling:
                A method is called using the object name or directly if it is static.

Example:
        display();

Advantages of Methods:
                    1. Code reusability
                    2. Better readability
                    3. Easy debugging
                    4. Modular programming

Methods help in organizing code into smaller, manageable parts and improve program structure.
