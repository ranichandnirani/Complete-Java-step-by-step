                                        Introduction to Java

---> Java is a high-level, object-oriented, and platform-independent programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now  Oracle). It is widely used for building secure, scalable, and reliable applications.

---> Java follows the principle “Write Once, Run Anywhere” (WORA), meaning Java programs can run on any system that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).


Key Features:-
            1. Platform Independent –   Runs on any OS using JVM.
            2. Object-Oriented –    Uses classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism.
            3. Secure –     Strong memory management and security features.
            4. Robust –     Handles errors efficiently.
            5. Multithreaded –  Supports concurrent execution.
            6. Portable –   Architecture-neutral bytecode.


Applications of Java:-
                    1. Web Applications
                    2. Android Development
                    3. Desktop Applications
                    4. Enterprise Systems
                    5. Cloud-Based Applications


Why Learn Java?
                Java is in-demand, beginner-friendly, and widely used in industry and academics, making it an excellent choice for students and developers.
