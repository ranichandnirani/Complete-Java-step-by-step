Sorting is the process of arranging data in a specific order – ascending or descending.

Types of Sorting:
1. Bubble Sort:
                Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

Simple but inefficient for large arrays.

2. Selection Sort:
                Finds the minimum element and places it at the beginning.

3. Insertion Sort:
                Builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting elements at the correct position.


Other Sorting Algorithms:
                        Merge Sort – Divide and conquer, efficient for large arrays
                        Quick Sort – Partition-based, fast average-case performance

Sorting organizes data and improves search efficiency.
Bubble, Selection, and Insertion are easy to implement;
Merge and Quick Sort are used for large datasets.
