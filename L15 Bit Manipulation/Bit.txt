Bit manipulation is the process of operating directly on binary digits (bits) using bitwise operators.
It is used for fast and memory-efficient operations.

Bitwise Operators:
                    Operator	    Name	                    Description

                    1.&	            AND	                        Sets bit to 1 if both bits are 1                    
                    2.`	            `	                        OR                  
                    3.^	            XOR	                        Sets bit to 1 if bits are different                 
                    4.~	            NOT	                        Inverts all bits                    
                    5.<<	        Left Shift	                Shifts bits to the left                 
                    6.>>	        Right Shift	                Shifts bits to the right

Common Bit Manipulation Operations:
1. Check if a bit is set:
                        (n & (1 << i)) != 0

2. Set a bit:
            n = n | (1 << i);

3. Clear a bit:
            n = n & ~(1 << i);

4. Toggle a bit:
            n = n ^ (1 << i);

Advantages:
        1. Faster execution
        2. Efficient memory usage
        3. Used in low-level programming

Bit manipulation allows efficient control of data at the binary level and is widely used in performance-critical applications.
