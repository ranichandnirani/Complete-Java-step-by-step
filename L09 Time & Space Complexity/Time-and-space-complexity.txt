What is Time & Space Complexity?

Time Complexity:- How much time an algorithm takes as input size increases.(Fast code vs slow code)
Space Complexity:- How much memory (RAM) an algorithm uses.

Think of it like:-
                    Time = how fast you cook.
                    Space = how many utensils you use.

Types of Time Complexity (Simple)

O(1) → Constant time (super fast)
O(log n) → Logarithmic (pretty fast)
O(n) → Linear (normal speed)
O(n log n) → Faster than quadratic
O(n²) → Slow
O(2ⁿ), O(n!) → Very slow

Difference Between Time & Space Complexity:-

Time Complexity	            Space Complexity
Measures speed	            Measures memory
Focus: execution time	    Focus: RAM usage
Affects performance	        Affects memory usage

What are Big O, Omega, Theta? (Very Easy)

1. Big O (O):- Shows worst-case performance.
Example:- Traffic jam situation.
2. Omega (Ω):- Shows best-case performance.
Example:- Empty road.
3. Theta (Θ):- Shows average case.
Example:- Normal traffic.

Super Short Summary (5 lines):-

Time = speed, Space = memory.
Big O = worst case.
Omega = best case.
Theta = average case.
