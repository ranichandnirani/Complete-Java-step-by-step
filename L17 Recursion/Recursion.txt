Iteration:
            Iteration is the process of repeating a set of instructions using loops like for, while, or do-while.

Key Points:-
            1. Uses loops.
            2. Condition-controlled repetition
            3. Faster and memory-efficient
            4. Easy to debug

Best used when:
                The number of repetitions is known or performance matters.

Recursion:
            Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it into smaller subproblems.

Key Points:-
            1. Function calls itself
            2. Must have a base case
            3. Uses more memory (stack)
            4. Code can be cleaner for complex problems

Best used when:
                The problem is naturally recursive (trees, graphs, divide & conquer).
