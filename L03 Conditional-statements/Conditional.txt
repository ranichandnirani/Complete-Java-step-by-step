                                        Conditional Statements in Java

Conditional statements are used to make decisions in a Java program.
They allow the program to execute different code blocks based on conditions.


1. if Statement:
                Executes a block of code only if the condition is true.

Syntax:
            if (condition) {
                // code
            }

2. if–else Statement:
                    Executes one block if the condition is true, otherwise executes another block.

Syntax:
        if (condition) {
            // true block
        } else {
            // false block
        }

3. else–if Ladder:
                Used to test multiple conditions.

Syntax:
        if (condition1) {
            // code
        } else if (condition2) {
            // code
        } else {
            // default code
        }

4. Nested if:
            An if statement inside another if statement.

Use:
    When one condition depends on another.

5. switch Statement:
                    Executes one case from multiple choices based on a value.

Syntax:
        switch (expression) {
            case value1:
            break;

            case value2:
            break;

            default:
        }

Conditional statements control the flow of execution in Java programs and help in decision-making.
