Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a given condition is met.

1. for Loop:
            Used when the number of iterations is known.
Syntax:
        for (initialization; condition; update) {
            // code
        }

2. while Loop:
            Executes code as long as the condition is true.
Syntax:
        while (condition) {
            // code
        }

3. do–while Loop:
                Executes the loop at least once, even if the condition is false.
Syntax:
        do {
            // code
        } while (condition);

Loop Control Statements:
                        1. break – exits the loop
                        2. continue – skips the current iteration

Loops reduce code repetition and improve program efficiency.
for loop is most commonly used in Java.
